Summary for Policymakers
A: Introduction
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents key findings of the Working Group II (WGII) contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of 
the IPCC1. The report builds on the WGII contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC, three Special Reports2, and the Working 
Group I (WGI) contribution to the AR6 cycle.
This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity3, and human societies (Figure  SPM.1) and integrates 
knowledge more strongly across the natural, ecological, social and economic sciences than earlier IPCC assessments. The assessment of climate 
change impacts and risks as well as adaptation is set against concurrently unfolding non-climatic global trends e.g., biodiversity loss, overall 
unsustainable consumption of natural resources, land and ecosystem degradation, rapid urbanisation, human demographic shifts, social and 
economic inequalities and a pandemic.
The scientific evidence for each key finding is found in the 18 chapters of the underlying report and in the 7 cross-chapter papers as well as the 
integrated synthesis presented in the Technical Summary (hereafter TS) and referred to in curly brackets {}. Based on scientific understanding, key 
findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of confidence using the IPCC calibrated language4. The WGII 
Global to Regional Atlas (Annex I) facilitates exploration of key synthesis findings across the WGII regions.
The concept of risk is central to all three AR6 Working Groups. A risk framing and the concepts of adaptation, vulnerability, exposure, resilience, 
equity and justice, and transformation provide alternative, overlapping, complementary, and widely used entry points to the literature assessed 
in this WGII report.
Across all three AR6 working groups, risk5 provides a framework for understanding the increasingly severe, interconnected and often irreversible 
impacts of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human systems; differing impacts across regions, sectors and communities; and 
how to best reduce adverse consequences for current and future generations. In the context of climate change, risk can arise from the dynamic 
interactions among climate-related hazards6 (see Working Group I), the exposure7 and vulnerability8 of affected human and ecological systems. 
The risk that can be introduced by human responses to climate change is a new aspect considered in the risk concept. This report identifies 127 
key risks9. {1.3, 16.5}
The vulnerability of exposed human and natural systems is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus in the literature. 
Approaches to analysing and assessing vulnerability have evolved since previous IPCC assessments. Vulnerability is widely understood to differ 
within communities and across societies, regions and countries, also changing through time.
Adaptation10 plays a key role in reducing exposure and vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation in ecological systems includes autonomous 
adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. In human systems, adaptation can be anticipatory or reactive, as well as incremental

Decision IPCC/XLVI-3, The assessment covers scientific literature accepted for publication by 1 September 2021.
2	
The three Special Reports are: ‘Global Warming of 1.5°C. An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission 
pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5)’; ‘Climate Change and Land. An IPCC 
Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL)’; ‘IPCC Special Report 
on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)’.
3	
Biodiversity: Biodiversity or biological diversity means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, among other things, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the 
ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems.
4	
Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, 
e.g., medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, 
as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other AR6 Reports.
5	
Risk is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems.
6	
Hazard is defined as the potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, 
infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources. Physical climate conditions that may be associated with hazards are assessed in Working Group I as climatic 
impact-drivers.
7	
Exposure is defined as the presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets in places and 
settings that could be adversely affected.
8	
Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and 
lack of capacity to cope and adapt.
9	
Key risks have potentially severe adverse consequences for humans and social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of climate related hazards with vulnerabilities of societies and systems 
exposed.
10	
Adaptation is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to moderate harm or take advantage of beneficial opportunities. In natural 
systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate this.

(b) Options to reduce climate risks and establish resilience
Figure SPM.1 | This report has a strong focus on the interactions among the coupled systems climate, ecosystems (including their biodiversity) and human society. These interactions are the basis of emerging risks 
from climate change, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and, at the same time, offer opportunities for the future. 
(a)  Human society causes climate change. Climate change, through hazards, exposure and vulnerability generates impacts and risks that can surpass limits to adaptation and result in losses and damages. Human society can adapt to, 
maladapt and mitigate climate change, ecosystems can adapt and mitigate within limits. Ecosystems and their biodiversity provision livelihoods and ecosystem services. Human society impacts ecosystems and can restore and conserve them. 
(b)  Meeting the objectives of climate resilient development thereby supporting human, ecosystem and planetary health, as well as human well-being, requires society and ecosystems to move over (transition) to a more resilient state. 
The recognition of climate risks can strengthen adaptation and mitigation actions and transitions that reduce risks. Taking action is enabled by governance, finance, knowledge and capacity building, technology and catalysing conditions. 
Transformation entails system transitions strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and society (Section D). In a) arrow colours represent principle human society interactions (blue), ecosystem (including biodiversity) interactions (green) 
and the impacts of climate change and human activities, including losses and damages, under continued climate change (red). In b) arrow colours represent human system interactions (blue), ecosystem (including biodiversity) interactions 
(green) and reduced impacts from climate change and human activities (grey). {1.2, Figure 1.2, Figure TS. 2}

Summary for Policymakers
and/ or transformational. The latter changes the fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and its 
impacts. Adaptation is subject to hard and soft limits11.
Resilience12 in the literature has a wide range of meanings. Adaptation is often organized around resilience as bouncing back and returning to 
a previous state after a disturbance. More broadly the term describes not just the ability to maintain essential function, identity and structure, 
but also the capacity for transformation.
This report recognises the value of diverse forms of knowledge such as scientific, as well as Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in 
understanding and evaluating climate adaptation processes and actions to reduce risks from human-induced climate change. AR6 highlights 
adaptation solutions which are effective, feasible13, and conform to principles of justice14. The term climate justice, while used in different ways in 
different contexts by different communities, generally includes three principles: distributive justice which refers to the allocation of burdens and 
benefits among individuals, nations and generations; procedural justice which refers to who decides and participates in decision-making; and 
recognition which entails basic respect and robust engagement with and fair consideration of diverse cultures and perspectives.
Effectiveness refers to the extent to which an action reduces vulnerability and climate-related risk, increases resilience, and avoids maladaptation15.
This report has a particular focus on transformation16 and system transitions in energy; land, ocean, coastal and freshwater ecosystems; urban, 
rural and infrastructure; and industry and society. These transitions make possible the adaptation required for high levels of human health and 
well-being, economic and social resilience, ecosystem health17, and planetary health18 (Figure SPM.1). These system transitions are also important 
for achieving the low global warming levels (Working Group III) that would avoid many limits to adaptation11. The report also assesses economic 
and non-economic losses and damages19. This report labels the process of implementing mitigation and adaptation together in support of 
sustainable development for all as climate resilient development20.
Box SPM.1 | AR6 Common Climate Dimensions, Global Warming Levels and Reference Periods
Assessments of climate risks consider possible future climate change, societal development and responses. This report assesses literature 
including that based on climate model simulations that are part of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 
(CMIP5, CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from 
illustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)21 and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)22 scenarios, respectively23. 
Climate impacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though 
some recent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Given differences in the impacts literature regarding

Adaptation limits: The point at which an actor’s objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. 
Hard adaptation limit—No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks. 
Soft adaptation limit—Options may exist but are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action.
12	
Resilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and ecosystems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their 
essential function, identity and structure as well as biodiversity in case of ecosystems while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Resilience is a positive attribute 
when it maintains such a capacity for adaptation, learning, and/or transformation.
13	
Feasibility refers to the potential for an adaptation option to be implemented.
14	
Justice is concerned with setting out the moral or legal principles of fairness and equity in the way people are treated, often based on the ethics and values of society. Social justice comprises just or 
fair relations within society that seek to address the distribution of wealth, access to resources, opportunity and support according to principles of justice and fairness. Climate justice comprises justice 
that links development and human rights to achieve a rights-based approach to addressing climate change.
15	
Maladaptation refers to actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate 
change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence.
16	
Transformation refers to a change in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems.
17	
Ecosystem health: a metaphor used to describe the condition of an ecosystem, by analogy with human health. Note that there is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem. Rather, 
the apparent health status of an ecosystem is judged on the ecosystem’s resilience to change, with details depending upon which metrics (such as species richness and abundance) are employed in 
judging it and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment.
18	
Planetary health: a concept based on the understanding that human health and human civilisation depend on ecosystem health and the wise stewardship of ecosystems.
19	
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic.
20	
In the WGII report, climate resilient development refers to the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support sustainable development for all.
21	
RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.
22	
SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the scenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of 
radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.
23	
IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the SSPs, which do not cover all possible scenarios. Alternative scenarios may be considered or developed.

Summary for Policymakers
socioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as 
appropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development. There are 
many emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome. These represent a broad range 
of possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability. Where available, WGII 
also assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios 
are analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs22. The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including 
impacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding. {1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 
SPM.C, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6 12, AR5 WGI}
A common set of reference years and time periods are adopted for assessing climate change and its impacts and risks: the reference 
period 1850–1900 approximates pre-industrial global surface temperature, and three future reference periods cover the near-term 
(2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100). {CCB CLIMATE}
Common levels of global warming relative to 1850–1900 are used to contextualize and facilitate analysis, synthesis and communication 
of assessed past, present and future climate change impacts and risks considering multiple lines of evidence. Robust geographical 
patterns of many variables can be identified at a given level of global warming, common to all scenarios considered and independent of 
timing when the global warming level is reached. {16.5, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 4.2, WGI AR6 CCB11.1}
WGI assessed the increase in global surface temperature is 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]24 °C in 2011–2020 above 1850–1900. The estimated 
increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] °C).25 
Considering all five illustrative scenarios assessed by WGI, there is at least a greater than 50% likelihood that global warming will reach 
or exceed 1.5°C in the near‐term, even for the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario26. { WGI AR6 SPM A1.2, WGI AR6 SPM B1.3, 
WGI AR6 Table SPM.1, WGI AR6 CCB 2.3}
B: Observed and Projected Impacts and Risks
Since AR5, the knowledge base on observed and projected impacts and risks generated by climate hazards, exposure and vulnerability has 
increased with impacts attributed to climate change and key risks identified across the report. Impacts and risks are expressed in terms of their 
damages, harms, economic, and non-economic losses. Risks from observed vulnerabilities and responses to climate change are highlighted. 
Risks are projected for the near-term (2021–2040), the mid (2041–2060) and long term (2081–2100), at different global warming levels and 
for pathways that overshoot 1.5°C global warming level for multiple decades27. Complex risks result from multiple climate hazards occurring 
concurrently, and from multiple risks interacting, compounding overall risk and resulting in risks transmitting through interconnected systems 
and across regions.
24	
In the WGI report, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.
25	
Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5.
26	
Global warming of 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 would be exceeded during the 21st century under the intermediate, high and very high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios considered in this report 
(SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Under the five illustrative scenarios, in the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high 
greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded 
under the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). Furthermore, for the very low 
greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), it is more likely than not that global surface temperature would decline back to below 1.5°C toward the end of the 21st century, with a temporary 
overshoot of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming.
27	
Overshoot: In this report, pathways that first exceed a specified global warming level (usually 1.5°C, by more than 0.1°C), and then return to or below that level again before the end of a specified 
period of time (e.g., before 2100). Sometimes the magnitude and likelihood of the overshoot is also characterized. The overshoot duration can vary from at least one decade up to several decades.

Attribution is defined as the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with an assessment of confidence. {Annex II Glossary, CWGB ATTRIB}
29	
Impacts of climate change are caused by slow onset and extreme events. Slow onset events are described among the climatic-impact drivers of the WGI AR6 and refer to the risks and impacts 
associated with e.g., increasing temperature means, desertification, decreasing precipitation, loss of biodiversity, land and forest degradation, glacial retreat and related impacts, ocean acidification, 
sea level rise and salinization (https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch).

Acute food insecurity can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result of shocks risking determinants of food 
security and nutrition, and used to assess the need for humanitarian action.
B.1	
Human-induced climate change, including more frequent and intense extreme events, has caused widespread adverse 
impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond natural climate variability. Some development and 
adaptation efforts have reduced vulnerability. Across sectors and regions the most vulnerable people and systems are ob-
served to be disproportionately affected. The rise in weather and climate extremes has led to some irreversible impacts as 
natural and human systems are pushed beyond their ability to adapt. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.2) {TS B.1, Figure TS.5,

B.1.1	
Widespread, pervasive impacts to ecosystems, people, settlements, and infrastructure have resulted from observed increases in the 
frequency and intensity of climate and weather extremes, including hot extremes on land and in the ocean, heavy precipitation events, 
drought and fire weather (high confidence). Increasingly since AR5, these observed impacts have been attributed28 to human-induced 
climate change particularly through increased frequency and severity of extreme events. These include increased heat-related human 
mortality (medium confidence), warm-water coral bleaching and mortality  (high confidence), and increased drought-related tree 
mortality (high confidence). Observed increases in areas burned by wildfires have been attributed to human-induced climate change 
in some regions (medium to high confidence). Adverse impacts from tropical cyclones, with related losses and damages19, have 
increased due to sea level rise and the increase in heavy precipitation (medium confidence). Impacts in natural and human systems 
from slow-onset processes29 such as ocean acidification, sea level rise or regional decreases in precipitation have also been attributed 
to human induced climate change (high confidence). {1.3, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 4.2, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, 5.12, 7.2, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.11,

as well as shifts in seasonal timing have occurred due to climate change (high confidence), with adverse socioeconomic consequences 
(high confidence). Approximately half of the species assessed globally have shifted polewards or, on land, also to higher elevations 
(very high confidence). Hundreds of local losses of species have been driven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes (high 
confidence), as well as mass mortality events on land and in the ocean (very high confidence) and loss of kelp forests (high confidence). 
Some losses are already irreversible, such as the first species extinctions driven by climate change (medium confidence). Other impacts 
are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in 
some mountain (medium confidence) and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2a). { TS B.1,

Climate change including increases in frequency and intensity of extremes have reduced food and water security, hindering efforts 
to meet Sustainable Development Goals (high confidence). Although overall agricultural productivity has increased, climate change 
has slowed this growth over the past 50 years globally (medium confidence), related negative impacts were mainly in mid- and low 
latitude regions but positive impacts occurred in some high latitude regions (high confidence). Ocean warming and ocean acidification 
have adversely affected food production from shellfish aquaculture and fisheries in some oceanic regions (high confidence). Increasing 
weather and climate extreme events have exposed millions of people to acute food insecurity30 and reduced water security, with the 
largest impacts observed in many locations and/or communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Small Islands and the Arctic 
(high confidence). Jointly, sudden losses of food production and access to food compounded by decreased diet diversity have increased 
malnutrition in many communities (high confidence), especially for Indigenous Peoples, small-scale food producers and low-income 
households (high confidence), with children, elderly people and pregnant women particularly impacted (high confidence). Roughly half 
of the world’s population currently experience severe water scarcity for at least some part of the year due to climatic and non-climatic 
drivers (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2b) {3.5, 4.3, 4.4, Box 4.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.8, 5.9, 5.12, 7.1, 7.2, 9.8, 10.4, 11.3, 12.3, 13.5, 14.4,

Figure SPM.2 |  Observed global and regional impacts on ecosystems and human systems attributed to climate change. Confidence levels reflect uncertainty 
in attribution of the observed impact to climate change. Global assessments focus on large studies, multi-species, meta-analyses and large reviews. For that reason they can be 
assessed with higher confidence than regional studies, which may often rely on smaller studies that have more limited data. Regional assessments consider evidence on impacts 
across an entire region and do not focus on any country in particular. 
(a)  Climate change has already altered terrestrial, freshwater and ocean ecosystems at global scale, with multiple impacts evident at regional and local scales where there is 
sufficient literature to make an assessment. Impacts are evident on ecosystem structure, species geographic ranges and timing of seasonal life cycles (phenology) (for methodology 
and detailed references to chapters and cross-chapter papers see SMTS.1 and SMTS.1.1).

Summary for Policymakers
B.1.4	
Climate change has adversely affected physical health of people globally (very high confidence) and mental health of people in the 
assessed regions (very high confidence). Climate change impacts on health are mediated through natural and human systems, including 
economic and social conditions and disruptions (high confidence). In all regions extreme heat events have resulted in human mortality 
and morbidity (very high confidence). The occurrence of climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases has increased (very high 
confidence). The incidence of vector-borne diseases has increased from range expansion and/or increased reproduction of disease vectors 
(high confidence). Animal and human diseases, including zoonoses, are emerging in new areas (high confidence). Water and food-borne 
disease risks have increased regionally from climate-sensitive aquatic pathogens, including Vibrio spp. (high confidence), and from toxic 
substances from harmful freshwater cyanobacteria (medium confidence). Although diarrheal diseases have decreased globally, higher 
temperatures, increased rain and flooding have increased the occurrence of diarrheal diseases, including cholera (very high confidence) 
and other gastrointestinal infections (high confidence). In assessed regions, some mental health challenges are associated with increasing 
temperatures (high confidence), trauma from weather and climate extreme events (very high confidence), and loss of livelihoods and culture 
(high confidence). Increased exposure to wildfire smoke, atmospheric dust, and aeroallergens have been associated with climate-sensitive 
cardiovascular and respiratory distress (high confidence). Health services have been disrupted by extreme events such as floods (high 
confidence). {4.3, 5.12, 7.2, Box 7.3, 8.2, 8.3, Box 8.6, Figure 8.10, 9.10, Figure 9.33, Figure 9.34, 10.4, 11.3, 12.3, 13.7, 14.4, 14.5, 
Figure 14.8, 15.3, 16.2, CCP5.2, Table CCP5.1, CCP6.2, Figure CCP6.3, Table CCB ILLNESS.1}
B.1.5	
In urban settings, observed climate change has caused impacts on human health, livelihoods and key infrastructure (high confidence). 
Multiple climate and non-climate hazards impact cities, settlements and infrastructure and sometimes coincide, magnifying damage 
(high confidence). Hot extremes including heatwaves have intensified in cities (high confidence), where they have also aggravated 
air pollution events (medium confidence) and limited functioning of key infrastructure (high confidence). Observed impacts are 
concentrated amongst the economically and socially marginalized urban residents, e.g., in informal settlements (high confidence). 
Infrastructure, including transportation, water, sanitation and energy systems have been compromised by extreme and slow-onset 
events, with resulting economic losses, disruptions of services and impacts to well-being (high confidence). {4.3, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 9.9, 10.4, 
11.3, 12.3, 13.6, 14.5, 15.3, CCP2.2, CCP4.2, CCP5.2}
B.1.6 	
Overall adverse economic impacts attributable to climate change, including slow-onset and extreme weather events, have been 
increasingly identified (medium confidence). Some positive economic effects have been identified in regions that have benefited from 
lower energy demand as well as comparative advantages in agricultural markets and tourism (high confidence). Economic damages 
from climate change have been detected in climate-exposed sectors, with regional effects to agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, 
and tourism (high confidence), and through outdoor labour productivity (high confidence). Some extreme weather events, such as 
tropical cyclones, have reduced economic growth in the short-term (high confidence). Non-climatic factors including some patterns 
of settlement, and siting of infrastructure have contributed to the exposure of more assets to extreme climate hazards increasing the 
magnitude of the losses (high confidence). Individual livelihoods have been affected through changes in agricultural productivity, 
impacts on human health and food security, destruction of homes and infrastructure, and loss of property and income, with adverse 
effects on gender and social equity (high confidence). {3.5, 4.2, 5.12, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2, 9.6, 10.4, 13.10, 14.5, Box 14.6, 16.2, Table 16.5, 
18.3, CCP6.2, CCB GENDER, CWGB ECONOMICS}
B.1.7 	
Climate change is contributing to humanitarian crises where climate hazards interact with high vulnerability (high confidence). Climate 
and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in all regions (high confidence), with Small Island States disproportionately 
affected (high confidence). Flood and drought-related acute food insecurity and malnutrition have increased in Africa (high confidence) 
and Central and South America (high confidence). While non-climatic factors are the dominant drivers of existing intrastate violent 
conflicts, in some assessed regions extreme weather and climate events have had a small, adverse impact on their length, severity or 
frequency, but the statistical association is weak (medium confidence). Through displacement and involuntary migration from extreme 
weather and climate events, climate change has generated and perpetuated vulnerability (medium confidence). {4.2, 4.3, 5.4, 7.2, 9.8, 
Box 9.9, Box 10.4, 12.3, 12.5, 16.2, CCB DISASTER, CCB MIGRATE}
(b)  Climate change has already had diverse adverse impacts on human systems, including on water security and food production, health and well-being, and cities, settlements and 
infrastructure. The + and – symbols indicate the direction of observed impacts, with a – denoting an increasing adverse impact and a ± denoting that, within a region or globally, both 
adverse and positive impacts have been observed (e.g., adverse impacts in one area or food item may occur with positive impacts in another area or food item). Globally, ‘–’ denotes an 
overall adverse impact; ‘Water scarcity’ considers, e.g., water availability in general, groundwater, water quality, demand for water, drought in cities. Impacts on food production were 
assessed by excluding non-climatic drivers of production increases; Global assessment for agricultural production is based on the impacts on global aggregated production; ‘Reduced 
animal and livestock health and productivity’ considers, e.g., heat stress, diseases, productivity, mortality; ‘Reduced fisheries yields and aquaculture production’ includes marine and 
freshwater fisheries/production; ‘Infectious diseases’ include, e.g., water-borne and vector-borne diseases; ‘Heat, malnutrition and other’ considers, e.g., human heat-related morbidity 
and mortality, labour productivity, harm from wildfire, nutritional deficiencies; ‘Mental health’ includes impacts from extreme weather events, cumulative events, and vicarious or 
anticipatory events; ‘Displacement’ assessments refer to evidence of displacement attributable to climate and weather extremes; ‘Inland flooding and associated damages’ considers, 
e.g., river overflows, heavy rain, glacier outbursts, urban flooding; ‘Flood/storm induced damages in coastal areas’ include damages due to, e.g., cyclones, sea level rise, storm surges. 
Damages by key economic sectors are observed impacts related to an attributable mean or extreme climate hazard or directly attributed. Key economic sectors include standard 
classifications and sectors of importance to regions (for methodology and detailed references to chapters and cross-chapter papers see SMTS.1 and SMTS.1.2).

Vulnerability and Exposure of Ecosystems and People
31	
Governance: The structures, processes and actions through which private and public actors interact to address societal goals. This includes formal and informal institutions and the associated norms, 
rules, laws and procedures for deciding, managing, implementing and monitoring policies and measures at any geographic or political scale, from global to local.
32	
Balanced diets feature plant-based foods, such as those based on coarse grains, legumes fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-source foods produced in resilient, sustainable and 
low-greenhouse gas emissions systems, as described in SRCCL.
B.2	
Vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change differs substantially among and within regions (very high 
confidence), driven by patterns of intersecting socioeconomic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity, 
marginalization, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance31 (high confidence). 
Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change (high confidence). 
A high proportion of species is vulnerable to climate change (high confidence). Human and ecosystem vulnerability are 
interdependent (high confidence). Current unsustainable development patterns are increasing exposure of ecosystems 
and people to climate hazards (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 3.5, 4.3, 6.2, 8.2, 8.3, 9.4, 9.7, 10.4, 12.3, 14.5, 15.3, CCP5.2, 
CCP6.2, CCP7.3, CCP7.4, CCB GENDER}
B.2.1	
Since AR5 there is increasing evidence that degradation and destruction of ecosystems by humans increases the vulnerability of 
people (high confidence). Unsustainable land-use and land cover change, unsustainable use of natural resources, deforestation, loss 
of biodiversity, pollution, and their interactions, adversely affect the capacities of ecosystems, societies, communities and individuals 
to adapt to climate change (high confidence). Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on people 
globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems, to meet basic needs (high 
confidence). {2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.5, 3.6, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 5.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7, 5.8, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 9.6, 10.4, 11.3, 12.2, 12.5, 13.8, 14.4,

SLR}
B.2.2	
Non-climatic human-induced factors exacerbate current ecosystem vulnerability to climate change (very high confidence). Globally, 
and even within protected areas, unsustainable use of natural resources, habitat fragmentation, and ecosystem damage by pollutants 
increase ecosystem vulnerability to climate change (high confidence). Globally, less than 15% of the land, 21% of the freshwater and 
8% of the ocean are protected areas. In most protected areas, there is insufficient stewardship to contribute to reducing damage from, 
or increasing resilience to, climate change (high confidence). {2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.4, 3.6, 4.2, 4.3, 5.8, 9.6, 11.3, 12.3, 13.3, 13.4, 14.5, 15.3, 
CCP1.2, Figure CCP1.15, CCP2.1, CCP2.2, CCP4.2, CCP5.2, CCP6.2, CCP7.2, CCP7.3, CCB NATURAL}
B.2.3 	
Future vulnerability of ecosystems to climate change will be strongly influenced by the past, present and future development of human 
society, including from overall unsustainable consumption and production, and increasing demographic pressures, as well as persistent 
unsustainable use and management of land, ocean, and water (high confidence). Projected climate change, combined with non-climatic 
drivers, will cause loss and degradation of much of the world’s forests (high confidence), coral reefs and low-lying coastal wetlands 
(very high confidence). While agricultural development contributes to food security, unsustainable agricultural expansion, driven in part 
by unbalanced diets32, increases ecosystem and human vulnerability and leads to competition for land and/or water resources (high 
confidence). {2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 4.3, 4.5, 5.6, 5.12, 5.13, 7.2, 12.3, 13.3, 13.4, 13.10, 14.5, CCP1.2, CCP2.2, CCP5.2, CCP6.2, 
CCP7.2, CCP7.3, CCB HEALTH, CCB NATURAL}
B.2.4 	
Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards (high confidence). Global 
hotspots of high human vulnerability are found particularly in West-, Central- and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, 
Small Island Developing States and the Arctic (high confidence). Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges 
and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods (e.g., smallholder 
farmers, pastoralists, fishing communities) (high confidence). Between 2010–2020, human mortality from floods, droughts and storms 
was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low vulnerability (high confidence). Vulnerability 
at different spatial levels is exacerbated by inequity and marginalization linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations 
thereof (high confidence), especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities (high confidence). Present development 
challenges causing high vulnerability are influenced by historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for 
many Indigenous Peoples and local communities (high confidence). {4.2, 5.12, 6.2, 6.4, 7.1, 7.2, Box 7.1, 8.2, 8.3, Box 8.4, Figure 8.6,

B.2.5	
Future human vulnerability will continue to concentrate where the capacities of local, municipal and national governments, 
communities and the private sector are least able to provide infrastructures and basic services (high confidence). Under the global 
trend of urbanization, human vulnerability will also concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements (high 
13
SPM
Summary for Policymakers
confidence). In rural areas vulnerability will be heightened by compounding processes including high emigration, reduced habitability and 
high reliance on climate-sensitive livelihoods (high confidence). Key infrastructure systems including sanitation, water, health, transport, 
communications and energy will be increasingly vulnerable if design standards do not account for changing climate conditions (high 
confidence). Vulnerability will also rapidly rise in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise and 
in some mountain regions, already characterised by high vulnerability due to high dependence on climate-sensitive livelihoods, rising 
population displacement, the accelerating loss of ecosystem services and limited adaptive capacities (high confidence). Future exposure 
to climatic hazards is also increasing globally due to socioeconomic development trends including migration, growing inequality and 
urbanization (high confidence). {4.5, 5.5, 6.2, 7.2, 8.3, 9.9, 9.11, 10.3, 10.4, 12.3, 12.5, 13.6, 14.5, 15.3, 15.4, 16.5, CCP2.3, CCP4.3,

Risks in the near term (2021–2040)
B.3	
Global warming, reaching 1.5°C in the near-term, would cause unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards and 
present multiple risks to ecosystems and humans (very high confidence). The level of risk will depend on concurrent near-
term trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socioeconomic development and adaptation (high confidence). Near-term 
actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C would substantially reduce projected losses and damages related to 
climate change in human systems and ecosystems, compared to higher warming levels, but cannot eliminate them all 
(very high confidence). (Figure SPM.3, Box SPM.1) {16.4, 16.5, 16.6, CCP1.2, CCP5.3, CCB SLR, WGI AR6 SPM B1.3, WGI AR6 
Table SPM.1}
B.3.1	
Near-term warming and increased frequency, severity and duration of extreme events will place many terrestrial, freshwater, coastal 
and marine ecosystems at high or very high risks of biodiversity loss (medium to very high confidence, depending on ecosystem). 
Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to high in forest ecosystems (medium confidence), kelp and seagrass ecosystems 
(high to very high confidence), and high to very high in Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems (high confidence) and warm-water 
coral reefs (very high confidence). Continued and accelerating sea level rise will encroach on coastal settlements and infrastructure 
(high confidence) and commit low-lying coastal ecosystems to submergence and loss (medium confidence). If trends in urbanisation in 
exposed areas continue, this will exacerbate the impacts, with more challenges where energy, water and other services are constrained 
(medium confidence). The number of people at risk from climate change and associated loss of biodiversity will progressively increase 
(medium confidence). Violent conflict and, separately, migration patterns, in the near-term will be driven by socioeconomic conditions 
and governance more than by climate change (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {2.5, 3.4, 4.6, 6.2, 7.3, 8.7, 9.2, 9.9, 11.6, 12.5, 13.6,

B.3.2	
In the near term, climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in their vulnerability and 
exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios (high confidence). Regional differences exist, and risks 
are highest where species and people exist close to their upper thermal limits, along coastlines, in close association with ice or seasonal 
rivers (high confidence). Risks are also high where multiple non-climate drivers persist or where vulnerability is otherwise elevated 
(high confidence). Many of these risks are unavoidable in the near-term, irrespective of emissions scenario (high confidence). Several 
risks can be moderated with adaptation (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3, Section C) {2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 4.5, 6.2, 7.1, 7.3, 8.2, 11.6, 12.4,

B.3.3	
Levels of risk for all Reasons for Concern (RFC) are assessed to become high to very high at lower global warming levels than in 
AR5 (high confidence). Between 1.2°C and 4.5°C global warming level very high risks emerge in all five RFCs compared to just two 
RFCs in AR5 (high confidence). Two of these transitions from high to very high risk are associated with near-term warming: risks to 
unique and threatened systems at a median value of 1.5 [1.2 to 2.0] °C (high confidence) and risks associated with extreme weather 
events at a median value of 2.0 [1.8 to 2.5] °C (medium confidence). Some key risks contributing to the RFCs are projected to lead to 
widespread, pervasive, and potentially irreversible impacts at global warming levels of 1.5–2°C if exposure and vulnerability are high 
and adaptation is low (medium confidence). Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C would substantially reduce 
projected losses and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems, compared to higher warming levels, but 
cannot eliminate them all (very high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) {16.5, 16.6, CCB SLR}

The term ‘very high risks of extinction’ is used here consistently with the IUCN categories and criteria and equates with ‘critically endangered’.
B.4	
Beyond 2040 and depending on the level of global warming, climate change will lead to numerous risks to natural and 
human systems (high confidence). For 127 identified key risks, assessed mid- and long-term impacts are up to multiple 
times higher than currently observed (high confidence). The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks 
depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, and projected adverse impacts and related losses and 
damages escalate with every increment of global warming (very high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {2.5, 3.4, 4.4, 5.2, 6.2, 
7.3, 8.4, 9.2, 10.2, 11.6, 12.4, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 13.8, 14.6, 15.3, 16.5, 16.6, CCP1.2, CCP2.2, CCP3.3, CCP4.3, 
CCP5.3, CCP6.3, CCP7.3}
B.4.1 	
Biodiversity loss and degradation, damages to and transformation of ecosystems are already key risks for every region due to past 
global warming and will continue to escalate with every increment of global warming (very high confidence). In terrestrial ecosystems, 
3 to 14% of species assessed33 will likely face very high risk of extinction34 at global warming levels of 1.5°C, increasing up to 3 to 
18% at 2°C, 3 to 29% at 3°C, 3 to 39% at 4°C, and 3 to 48% at 5°C. In ocean and coastal ecosystems, risk of biodiversity loss ranges 
between moderate and very high by 1.5°C global warming level and is moderate to very high by 2°C but with more ecosystems at high 
and very high risk (high confidence), and increases to high to very high across most ocean and coastal ecosystems by 3°C (medium 
to high confidence, depending on ecosystem). Very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots is projected to at 
least double from 2% between 1.5°C and 2°C global warming levels and to increase at least tenfold if warming rises from 1.5°C to 
3°C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.3c, d, f) {2.4, 2.5, 3.4, 3.5,12.3, 12.5, Table 12.6, 13.4, 13.10, 16.4, 16.6, CCP1.2, Figure CCP1.6, 
Figure CCP1.7, CCP5.3, CCP6.3, CCB PALEO}
B.4.2	
Risks in physical water availability and water-related hazards will continue to increase by the mid- to long-term in all assessed regions, 
with greater risk at higher global warming levels (high confidence). At approximately 2°C global warming, snowmelt water availability 
for irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt dependent river basins by up to 20%, and global glacier mass loss of 18 ± 13% 
is projected to diminish water availability for agriculture, hydropower, and human settlements in the mid- to long-term, with these 
changes projected to double with 4°C global warming (medium confidence). In Small Islands, groundwater availability is threatened by 
climate change (high confidence). Changes to streamflow magnitude, timing and associated extremes are projected to adversely impact 
freshwater ecosystems in many watersheds by the mid- to long-term across all assessed scenarios (medium confidence). Projected 
increases in direct flood damages are higher by 1.4 to 2 times at 2°C and 2.5 to 3.9 times at 3°C compared to 1.5°C global warming 
without adaptation (medium confidence). At global warming of 4°C, approximately 10% of the global land area is projected to face 
increases in both extreme high and low river flows in the same location, with implications for planning for all water use sectors (medium 
confidence). Challenges for water management will be exacerbated in the near, mid and long term, depending on the magnitude, rate 
and regional details of future climate change and will be particularly challenging for regions with constrained resources for water 
management (high confidence). {2.3, 4.4, 4.5, Box 4.2, Figure 4.20, 15.3, CCP5.3, CCB DISASTER, SROCC 2.3}
B.4.3	
Climate change will increasingly put pressure on food production and access, especially in vulnerable regions, undermining food security 
and nutrition (high confidence).  Increases in frequency, intensity and severity of droughts, floods and heatwaves, and continued sea 
level rise will increase risks to food security (high confidence) in vulnerable regions from moderate to high between 1.5°C and 2°C 
global warming level, with no or low levels of adaptation (medium confidence). At 2°C or higher global warming level in the mid-term, 
food security risks due to climate change will be more severe, leading to malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies, concentrated 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Central and South America and Small Islands (high confidence). Global warming will progressively 
weaken soil health and ecosystem services such as pollination, increase pressure from pests and diseases, and reduce marine animal 
biomass, undermining food productivity in many regions on land and in the ocean (medium confidence). At 3°C or higher global warming 
level in the long term, areas exposed to climate-related hazards will expand substantially compared with 2°C or lower global warming 
level (high confidence), exacerbating regional disparity in food security risks (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {1.1, 3.3, 4.5, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5,

Summary for Policymakers
B.4.4	
Climate change and related extreme events will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths from the near- to long-term (high 
confidence). Globally, population exposure to heatwaves will continue to increase with additional warming, with strong geographical 
differences in heat-related mortality without additional adaptation (very high confidence). Climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, 
and vector-borne disease risks are projected to increase under all levels of warming without additional adaptation (high confidence). In 
particular, dengue risk will increase with longer seasons and a wider geographic distribution in Asia, Europe, Central and South America 
and sub-Saharan Africa, potentially putting additional billions of people at risk by the end of the century (high confidence). Mental health 
challenges, including anxiety and stress, are expected to increase under further global warming in all assessed regions, particularly for 
children, adolescents, elderly, and those with underlying health conditions (very high confidence). {4.5, 5.12, Box 5.10, 7.3, Figure 7.9, 
8.4, 9.10, Figure 9.32, Figure 9.35, 10.4, Figure 10.11, 11.3, 12.3, Figure 12.5, Figure 12.6, 13.7, Figure 13.23, Figure 13.24, 14.5, 15.3, 
CCP6.2}
B.4.5	
Climate change risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure will rise rapidly in the mid- and long-term with further global 
warming, especially in places already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities (high confidence). 
Globally, population change in low-lying cities and settlements will lead to approximately a billion people projected to be at risk 
from coastal-specific climate hazards in the mid-term under all scenarios, including in Small Islands (high confidence). The population 
potentially exposed to a 100-year coastal flood is projected to increase by about 20% if global mean sea level rises by 0.15 m relative 
to 2020 levels; this exposed population doubles at a 0.75 m rise in mean sea level and triples at 1.4 m without population change 
and additional adaptation (medium confidence). Sea level rise poses an existential threat for some Small Islands and some low-lying 
coasts (medium confidence). By 2100 the value of global assets within the future 1-in-100 year coastal floodplains is projected to 
be between US$7.9 and US$12.7 trillion (2011 value) under RCP4.5, rising to between US$8.8 and US$14.2 trillion under RCP8.5 
(medium confidence). Costs for maintenance and reconstruction of urban infrastructure, including building, transportation, and energy 
will increase with global warming level (medium confidence), the associated functional disruptions are projected to be substantial 
particularly for cities, settlements and infrastructure located on permafrost in cold regions and on coasts (high confidence). {6.2, 9.9, 
10.4, 13.6, 13.10, 15.3, 16.5, CCP2.1, CCP2.2, CCP5.3, CCP6.2, CCB SLR, SROCC 2.3, SROCC CCB9}
B.4.6	
Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages generally increase non-linearly with global warming levels (high 
confidence).35 The wide range of global estimates, and the lack of comparability between methodologies, does not allow for identification 
of a robust range of estimates (high confidence). The existence of higher estimates than assessed in AR5 indicates that global aggregate 
economic impacts could be higher than previous estimates (low confidence).36 Significant regional variation in aggregate economic 
damages from climate change is projected (high confidence) with estimated economic damages per capita for developing countries 
often higher as a fraction of income (high confidence). Economic damages, including both those represented and those not represented 
in economic markets, are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 3°C or higher global warming levels (high confidence). {4.4, 9.11, 11.5, 
13.10, Box 14.6, 16.5, CWGB ECONOMIC}
B.4.7 	
In the mid- to long-term, displacement will increase with intensification of heavy precipitation and associated flooding, tropical cyclones, 
drought and, increasingly, sea level rise (high confidence). At progressive levels of warming, involuntary migration from regions with 
high exposure and low adaptive capacity would occur (medium confidence). Compared to other socioeconomic factors the influence of 
climate on conflict is assessed as relatively weak (high confidence). Along long-term socioeconomic pathways that reduce non-climatic 
drivers, risk of violent conflict would decline (medium confidence). At higher global warming levels, impacts of weather and climate 
extremes, particularly drought, by increasing vulnerability will increasingly affect violent intrastate conflict (medium confidence). {TS 
B.7.4, 7.3, 16.5, CCB MIGRATE }

The assessment found estimated rates of increase in projected global economic damages that were both greater than linear and less than linear as global warming level increases. There is evidence 
that some regions could benefit from low levels of warming (high confidence). {CWGB ECONOMIC}

Absence of risk diagrams does not imply absence of risks within a 
region. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia and Central and 
South America was limited due to the paucity of adequately downscaled climate projections, 
with uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic 
contexts across countries within a region, and the resulting few numbers of impact and risk 
projections for different warming levels.
The risks listed are of at least medium conﬁdence level:

Asia - Urban infrastructure damage and impacts on human well-being and health due 
to ﬂooding, especially in coastal cities and settlements
- Biodiversity loss and habitat shifts as well as associated disruptions in 
dependent human systems across freshwater, land, and ocean ecosystems
- More frequent, extensive coral bleaching and subsequent coral mortality 
induced by ocean warming and acidiﬁcation, sea level rise, marine heat waves

Summary for Policymakers
Complex, Compound and Cascading Risks
B.5	
Climate change impacts and risks are becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Multiple climate 
hazards will occur simultaneously, and multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in compounding 
overall risk and risks cascading across sectors and regions. Some responses to climate change result in new impacts and 
risks. (high confidence) {1.3, 2.4, Box 2.2, Box 9.5, 11.5, 13.5, 14.6, Box 15.1, CCP1.2, CCP2.2, CCB COVID, CCB DISASTER, 
CCB INTEREG, CCB SRM, }
B.5.1	
Concurrent and repeated climate hazards occur in all regions, increasing impacts and risks to health, ecosystems, infrastructure, livelihoods 
and food (high confidence). Multiple risks interact, generating new sources of vulnerability to climate hazards, and compounding overall 
risk (high confidence). Increasing concurrence of heat and drought events are causing crop production losses and tree mortality (high 
confidence). Above 1.5°C global warming increasing concurrent climate extremes will increase risk of simultaneous crop losses of maize 
in major food-producing regions, with this risk increasing further with higher global warming levels (medium confidence). Future sea 
level rise combined with storm surge and heavy rainfall will increase compound flood risks (high confidence). Risks to health and food 
production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by 
heat-induced labour productivity losses (high confidence). These interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, 
and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions 
(high confidence). Risks to food safety from climate change will further compound the risks to health by increasing food contamination 
of crops from mycotoxins and contamination of seafood from harmful algal blooms, mycotoxins, and chemical contaminants (high 
confidence). {Figure TS.10c, 5.2, 5.4, 5.8, 5.9, 5.11, 5.12, 7.2, 7.3, 9.8, 9.11, 10.4, 11.3, 11.5, 12.3, 13.5, 14.5, 15.3, Box 15.1, 16.6, CCP1.2,

B.5.2	
Adverse impacts from climate hazards and resulting risks are cascading across sectors and regions (high confidence), propagating 
impacts along coasts and urban centres (medium confidence) and in mountain regions (high confidence). These hazards and cascading 
risks also trigger tipping points in sensitive ecosystems and in significantly and rapidly changing social-ecological systems impacted 
by ice melt, permafrost thaw and changing hydrology in polar regions (high confidence). Wildfires, in many regions, have affected 
ecosystems and species, people and their built assets, economic activity, and health (medium to high confidence). In cities and 
(a)  Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 model simulations with observational constraints based 
on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity (Box SPM.1). Changes relative to 1850–1900 based on 20-year averaging periods 
are calculated by adding 0.85°C (the observed global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 1995–2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995–2014. Very likely ranges 
are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 (WGI AR6 Figure SPM.8). Assessments were carried out at the global scale for (b), (c), (d) and (e). 
(b)  The Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk for five broad categories. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming 
low to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localized and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very high risk level has an 
emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. Undetectable risk level (white) indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk 
(yellow) indicates associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key 
risks; high risk (red) indicates severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks; and very high risk level (purple) indicates 
very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature 
of the hazard or impacts/risks. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.09°C which is used to separate the observed, past impacts below the line from the future 
projected risks above it. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and 
have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme 
weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, 
and coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, 
exposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives 
affected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused 
by global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods are described in SM16.6 and are identical to AR5, but are enhanced 
by a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6. 
Risks for (c) terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and (d) ocean ecosystems. For c) and d), diagrams shown for each risk assume low to no adaptation. The transition to a very high 
risk level has an emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. 
(e)  Climate-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The assessed projections were based on a range of scenarios, including SRES, 
CMIP5, and ISIMIP, and, in some cases, demographic trends. The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole ºC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP 
scenarios in panel (a). 
(f)  Examples of regional key risks. Risks identified are of at least medium confidence level. Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness 
of the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); 
likelihood of adverse consequences; temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation. The full set of 127 assessed global and regional key 
risks is given in SM16.7. Diagrams are provided for some risks. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia and Central and South America were limited by the 
availability of adequately downscaled climate projections, with uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socioeconomic contexts across countries 
within a region, and the resulting low number of impact and risk projections for different warming levels. Absence of risks diagrams does not imply absence of risks within a region.

Summary for Policymakers
settlements, climate impacts to key infrastructure are leading to losses and damages across water and food systems, and affect 
economic activity, with impacts extending beyond the area directly impacted by the climate hazard (high confidence). In Amazonia, 
and in some mountain regions, cascading impacts from climatic (e.g., heat) and non-climatic stressors (e.g., land use change) will result 
in irreversible and severe losses of ecosystem services and biodiversity at 2°C global warming level and beyond (medium confidence). 
Unavoidable sea level rise will bring cascading and compounding impacts resulting in losses of coastal ecosystems and ecosystem 
services, groundwater salinisation, flooding and damages to coastal infrastructure that cascade into risks to livelihoods, settlements, 
health, well-being, food and water security, and cultural values in the near to long-term (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {Figure TS.10, 
2.5, 3.4, 3.5, Box 7.3, Box 8.7, Box 9.4, 11.5, Box 11.1, 12.3, 13.9, 14.6, 15.3, 16.5, 16.6, CCP1.2, CCP2.2, CCP5.2, CCP5.3, CCP6.2,

B.5.3	
Weather and climate extremes are causing economic and societal impacts across national boundaries through supply-chains, markets, 
and natural resource flows, with increasing transboundary risks projected across the water, energy and food sectors (high confidence). 
Supply chains that rely on specialized commodities and key infrastructure can be disrupted by weather and climate extreme events. 
Climate change causes the redistribution of marine fish stocks, increasing risk of transboundary management conflicts among fisheries 
users, and negatively affecting equitable distribution of food provisioning services as fish stocks shift from lower to higher latitude regions, 
thereby increasing the need for climate-informed transboundary management and cooperation (high confidence). Precipitation and water 
availability changes increases the risk of planned infrastructure projects, such as hydropower in some regions, having reduced productivity 
for food and energy sectors including across countries that share river basins (medium confidence). {Figure TS.10e-f, 3.4, 3.5, 4.5, 5.8, 5.13, 
6.2, 9.4, Box 9.5,14.5, Box 14.5, Box 14.6, CCP5.3, CCB DISASTER, CCB EXTREMES, CCB INTEREG, CCB MOVING PLATE}
B.5.4	
Risks arise from some responses that are intended to reduce the risks of climate change, including risks from maladaptation and adverse 
side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures (high confidence). Deployment of afforestation of 
naturally unforested land, or poorly implemented bioenergy, with or without carbon capture and storage, can compound climate-related 
risks to biodiversity, water and food security, and livelihoods, especially if implemented at large scales, especially in regions with insecure 
land tenure (high confidence). {Box 2.2, 4.1, 4.7, 5.13, Table 5.18, Box 9.3, Box 13.2, CCB NATURAL, CWGB BIOECONOMY}
B.5.5	
Solar radiation modification approaches, if they were to be implemented, introduce a widespread range of new risks to people and 
ecosystems, which are not well understood (high confidence). Solar radiation modification approaches have potential to offset warming 
and ameliorate some climate hazards, but substantial residual climate change or overcompensating change would occur at regional 
scales and seasonal timescales (high confidence). Large uncertainties and knowledge gaps are associated with the potential of solar 
radiation modification approaches to reduce climate change risks. Solar radiation modification would not stop atmospheric CO2 
concentrations from increasing or reduce resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions (high confidence).

Impacts of Temporary Overshoot
37	
In this report, overshoot pathways exceed 1.5°C global warming and then return to that level, or below, after several decades.
38	
Despite limited evidence specifically on the impacts of a temporary overshoot of 1.5°C, a much broader evidence base from process understanding and the impacts of higher global warming levels 
allows a high confidence statement on the irreversibility of some impacts that would be incurred following such an overshoot.
B.6	
If global warming transiently exceeds 1.5°C in the coming decades or later (overshoot)37, then many human and natural 
systems will face additional severe risks, compared to remaining below 1.5°C (high confidence). Depending on the mag-
nitude and duration of overshoot, some impacts will cause release of additional greenhouse gases (medium confidence) 
and some will be irreversible, even if global warming is reduced (high confidence). (Box SPM.1, Figure SPM.3) {2.5, 3.4, 
12.3, 16.6, CCB DEEP, CCB SLR}
B.6.1	
While model-based assessments of the impacts of overshoot pathways are limited, observations and current understanding of processes 
permit assessment of impacts from overshoot. Additional warming, e.g., above 1.5°C during an overshoot period this century, will 
result in irreversible impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted 
by ice-sheet, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise (high confidence).38 Risks to human systems will 
increase, including those to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, some ecosystem-based adaptation measures, and associated 
livelihoods (high confidence), cultural and spiritual values (medium confidence). Projected impacts are less severe with shorter duration 
and lower levels of overshoot (medium confidence). {2.5, 3.4, 12.3, 13.2, 16.5, 16.6, CCP1.2, CCP2.2, CCP5.3, CCP6.1, CCP6.2, CCB SLR,

Summary for Policymakers
B.6.2 	
Risk of severe impacts increase with every additional increment of global warming during overshoot (high confidence). In high-carbon 
ecosystems (currently storing 3,000 to 4,000 GtC)39 such impacts are already observed and are projected to increase with every 
additional increment of global warming, such as increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, and thawing of 
permafrost, weakening natural land carbon sinks and increasing releases of greenhouse gases (medium confidence). The resulting 
contribution to a potential amplification of global warming indicates that a return to a given global warming level or below would be 
more challenging (medium confidence). {2.4, 2.5, CCP4.2, WGI AR6 SPM B.4.3, SROCC 5.4}

Adaptation, in response to current climate change, is reducing climate risks and vulnerability mostly via adjustment of existing systems. Many 
adaptation options exist and are used to help manage projected climate change impacts, but their implementation depends upon the capacity and 
effectiveness of governance and decision-making processes. These and other enabling conditions can also support climate resilient development 
(Section D).
Current Adaptation and its Benefits
39	
At the global scale, terrestrial ecosystems currently remove more carbon from the atmosphere (-3.4 ± 0.9 Gt yr-1) than they emit (+1.6 ± 0.7 Gt yr-1), a net sink of -1.9 ± 1.1 Gt yr-1. However, recent 
climate change has shifted some systems in some regions from being net carbon sinks to net carbon sources.
40	
Adaptation gaps are defined as the difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to tolerated climate change impacts and 
reflecting resource limitations and competing priorities.
C.1	
Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been observed across all sectors and regions, generating multiple 
benefits (very high confidence). However, adaptation progress is unevenly distributed with observed adaptation gaps40 (high 
confidence). Many initiatives prioritize immediate and near-term climate risk reduction which reduces the opportunity for 
transformational adaptation (high confidence). {2.6, 5.14, 7.4, 10.4, 12.5, 13.11, 14.7, 16.3, 17.3, CCP5.2, CCP5.4}
C.1.1	
Adaptation planning and implementation have continued to increase across all regions (very high confidence). Growing public and 
political awareness of climate impacts and risks has resulted in at least 170 countries and many cities including adaptation in their 
climate policies and planning processes (high confidence). Decision support tools and climate services are increasingly being used 
(very high confidence). Pilot projects and local experiments are being implemented in different sectors (high confidence). Adaptation 
can generate multiple additional benefits such as improving agricultural productivity, innovation, health and well-being, food security, 
livelihood, and biodiversity conservation as well as reduction of risks and damages (very high confidence). {1.4, 2.6, 3.5, 3.6, 4.7, 4.8, 
5.4, 5.6, 5.10, 6.4, 7.4, 8.5, 9.3, 9.6, 10.4, 12.5, 13.11, 15.5, 16.3, 17.2, 17.3, 17.5, CCP5.4, CCB ADAPT, CCB NATURAL}
C.1.2	
Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist between current levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts and reduce 
climate risks (high confidence). Most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, incremental, sector-specific, designed to 
respond to current impacts or near-term risks, and focused more on planning rather than implementation (high confidence). Observed 
adaptation is unequally distributed across regions (high confidence), and gaps are partially driven by widening disparities between the 
estimated costs of adaptation and documented finance allocated to adaptation (high confidence). The largest adaptation gaps exist 
among lower income population groups (high confidence). At current rates of adaptation planning and implementation the adaptation 
gap will continue to grow (high confidence). As adaptation options often have long implementation times, long-term planning and 
accelerated implementation, particularly in the next decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that constraints remain 
for some regions (high confidence). {1.1, 1.4, 5.6, 6.3, Figure 6.4, 7.4, 8.3, 10.4, 11.3, 11.7, 13.11, Box 13.1, 15.2, 15.5, 16.3, 16.5,

Summary for Policymakers
Future Adaptation Options and their Feasibility
41	
In this report, feasibility refers to the potential for a mitigation or adaptation option to be implemented. Factors influencing feasibility are context-dependent, temporally dynamic, and may vary between 
different groups and actors. Feasibility depends on geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional factors that enable or constrain the implementation 
of an option. The feasibility of options may change when different options are combined and increase when enabling conditions are strengthened.
42	
Effectiveness refers to the extent to which an adaptation option is anticipated or observed to reduce climate-related risk.
43	
In this report, the term natural forests describes those which are subject to little or no direct human intervention, whereas the term managed forests describes those where planting or other 
management activities take place, including those managed for commodity production.
C.2	
There are feasible41 and effective42 adaptation options which can reduce risks to people and nature. The feasibility of 
implementing adaptation options in the near-term differs across sectors and regions (very high confidence). The effec-
tiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions (high confidence) 
and will decrease with increasing warming (high confidence). Integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that address social in-
equities, differentiate responses based on climate risk and cut across systems, increase the feasibility and effectiveness of 
adaptation in multiple sectors (high confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {Figure TS.6e, 1.4, 3.6, 4.7, 5.12, 6.3, 7.4, 11.3, 11.7, 13.2, 
15.5, 17.6, CCP2.3, CCB FEASIB}
Land, Ocean and Ecosystems Transition
C.2.1	
Adaptation to water-related risks and impacts make up the majority of all documented adaptation (high confidence). For inland 
flooding, combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and structural measures like levees have reduced loss 
of lives (medium confidence). Enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, land use planning such 
as no build zones or upstream forest management, can further reduce flood risk (medium confidence). On-farm water management, 
water storage, soil moisture conservation and irrigation are some of the most common adaptation responses and provide economic, 
institutional or ecological benefits and reduce vulnerability (high confidence). Irrigation is effective in reducing drought risk and climate 
impacts in many regions and has several livelihood benefits, but needs appropriate management to avoid potential adverse outcomes, 
which can include accelerated depletion of groundwater and other water sources and increased soil salinization (medium confidence). 
Large scale irrigation can also alter local to regional temperature and precipitation patterns (high confidence), including both alleviating 
and exacerbating temperature extremes (medium confidence). The effectiveness of most water-related adaptation options to reduce 
projected risks declines with increasing warming (high confidence). {4.1, 4.6, 4.7, Box 4.3, Box 4.6, Box 4.7, Figure 4.22, Figure 4.28, 
Figure 4.29, Table 4.9, 9.3, 9.7, 11.3, 12.5, 13.1, 13.2, 16.3, CCP5.4}
C.2.2	
Effective adaptation options, together with supportive public policies enhance food availability and stability and reduce climate risk for 
food systems while increasing their sustainability (medium confidence). Effective options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, 
community-based adaptation, farm and landscape diversification, and urban agriculture  (high confidence). Institutional feasibility, 
adaptation limits of crops and cost effectiveness also influence the effectiveness of the adaptation options (limited evidence, medium 
agreement). Agroecological principles and practices, ecosystem-based management in fisheries and aquaculture, and other approaches 
that work with natural processes support food security, nutrition, health and well-being, livelihoods and biodiversity, sustainability and 
ecosystem services (high confidence). These services include pest control, pollination, buffering of temperature extremes, and carbon 
sequestration and storage (high confidence). Trade-offs and barriers associated with such approaches include costs of establishment, 
access to inputs and viable markets, new knowledge and management (high confidence) and their potential effectiveness varies by 
socioeconomic context, ecosystem zone, species combinations and institutional support (medium confidence). Integrated, multi-sectoral 
solutions that address social inequities and differentiate responses based on climate risk and local situation will enhance food security 
and nutrition (high confidence). Adaptation strategies which reduce food loss and waste or support balanced diets33 (as described in the 
IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land) contribute to nutrition, health, biodiversity and other environmental benefits (high 
confidence). {3.2, 4.7, 4.6, Box 4.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14, Box 5.10, Box 5.13, 6.3, 7.4, 10.4, 12.5, 13.5, 13.10,

C.2.3	
Adaptation for natural forests43 includes conservation, protection and restoration measures. In managed forests43, adaptation options 
include sustainable forest management, diversifying and adjusting tree species compositions to build resilience, and managing 
increased risks from pests and diseases and wildfires. Restoring natural forests and drained peatlands and improving sustainability 
of managed forests, generally enhances the resilience of carbon stocks and sinks. Cooperation, and inclusive decision making, with 
local communities and Indigenous Peoples, as well as recognition of inherent rights of Indigenous Peoples, is integral to successful 
forest adaptation in many areas. (high confidence) {2.6, Box 2.2, 5.6, 5.13, Table 5.23, 11.4, 12.5, 13.5, Box 14.1, Box 14.2, CCP7.5,

Figure SPM.4 |  (a) Climate responses and adaptation options, organized by System Transitions and Representative Key Risks (RKRs), are assessed for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the 
near term and up to 1.5°C global warming. As literature above 1.5°C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible to assess robustly. Climate responses and adaptation options at global 
scale are drawn from a set of options assessed in AR6 that have robust evidence across the feasibility dimensions. This figure shows the six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical) 
that are used to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility.

Summary for Policymakers
C.2.4	
Conservation, protection and restoration of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems, together with targeted management 
to adapt to unavoidable impacts of climate change, reduces the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change (high confidence). The 
resilience of species, biological communities and ecosystem processes increases with size of natural area, by restoration of degraded 
areas and by reducing non-climatic stressors (high confidence). To be effective, conservation and restoration actions will increasingly 
need to be responsive, as appropriate, to ongoing changes at various scales, and plan for future changes in ecosystem structure, 
community composition and species’ distributions, especially as 1.5°C global warming is approached and even more so if it is exceeded 
(high confidence). Adaptation options, where circumstances allow, include facilitating the movement of species to new ecologically 
appropriate locations, particularly through increasing connectivity  between conserved or protected areas, targeted intensive 
management for vulnerable species and protecting refugial areas where species can survive locally (medium confidence). {2.3, 2,6, 
Figure 2.1, Table 2.6, 3.3, 3.6, Box 3.4, 4.6, Box 4.6, Box 11.2, 12.3, 12.5, 13.4, 14.7, CCP5.4, CCB FEASIB}
C.2.5 	
Effective Ecosystem-based Adaptation44 reduces a range of climate change risks to people, biodiversity and ecosystem services with 
multiple co-benefits (high confidence). Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to climate change impacts, with effectiveness 
declining with increasing global warming (high confidence). Urban greening using trees and other vegetation can provide local cooling 
(very high confidence). Natural river systems, wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems reduce flood risk by storing water and slowing 
water flow, in most circumstances (high confidence). Coastal wetlands protect against coastal erosion and flooding associated with 
storms and sea level rise where sufficient space and adequate habitats are available until rates of sea level rise exceeds natural 
adaptive capacity to build sediment (very high confidence). {2.4, 2.5, 2.6, Table 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, Figure 3.26, 4.6, Box 4.6, Box 4.7, 5.5,

Urban, Rural and Infrastructure Transition
C.2.6	
Considering climate change impacts and risks in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements and infrastructure is critical 
for resilience and enhancing human well-being (high confidence). The urgent provision of basic services, infrastructure, livelihood 
diversification and employment, strengthening of local and regional food systems and community-based adaptation enhance lives and 
livelihoods, particularly of low-income and marginalised groups (high confidence). Inclusive, integrated and long-term planning at local, 
municipal, sub-national and national scales, together with effective regulation and monitoring systems and financial and technological 
resources and capabilities foster urban and rural system transition (high confidence). Effective partnerships between governments, civil 
society, and private sector organizations, across scales provide infrastructure and services in ways that enhance the adaptive capacity 
of vulnerable people (medium to high confidence). {5.12, 5.13, 5.14, 6.3, 6.4, Box 6.3, Box 6.6, Table 6.6, 7.4, 12.5, 13.6, 14.5, Box 14.4, 
Box 17.4, CCP2.3, CCP2.4, CCP5.4, CCB FEASIB}
C.2.7	
An increasing number of adaptation responses exist for urban systems, but their feasibility and effectiveness is constrained by 
institutional, financial, and technological access and capacity, and depends on coordinated and contextually appropriate responses 
across physical, natural and social infrastructure (high confidence). Globally, more financing is directed at physical infrastructure than 
natural and social infrastructure (medium confidence) and there is limited evidence of investment in the informal settlements hosting 
the most vulnerable urban residents (medium to high confidence). Ecosystem-based adaptation (e.g., urban agriculture and forestry, 
river restoration) has increasingly been applied in urban areas (high confidence). Combined ecosystem-based and structural adaptation 
responses are being developed, and there is growing evidence of their potential to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood 
control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention and coastal protection (medium confidence). {3.6, Box 4.6, 5.12, 
6.3, 6.4, Table 6.8, 7.4, 9.7, 9.9, 10.4, Table 10.3, 11.3, 11.7, Box 11.6, 12.5, 13.2, 13.3, 13.6, 14.5, 15.5, 17.2, Box 17.4, CCP2.3, CCP

Ecosystem based Adaptation (EbA) is recognised internationally under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD14/5). A related concept is Nature-based Solutions (NbS), which includes a broader 
range of approaches with safeguards, including those that contribute to adaptation and mitigation. The term ‘Nature-based Solutions’ is widely but not universally used in the scientific literature. The 
term is the subject of ongoing debate, with concerns that it may lead to the misunderstanding that NbS on its own can provide a global solution to climate change.
Figure SPM.4 |  (b) Climate responses and adaptation options, organized by System Transitions and Representative Key Risks, are assessed at global scale 
for their likely ability to reduce risks for ecosystems and social groups at risk, as well as their relation with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Climate responses and adaptation options are assessed for observed benefits (+) to ecosystems and their services, ethnic groups, gender equity, and low-income groups, or observed 
dis-benefits (-) for these systems and groups. Where there is highly diverging evidence of benefits/ dis-benefits across the scientific literature, e.g., based on differences between 
regions, it is shown as not clear or mixed (•). Insufficient evidence is shown by a dash. The relation with the SDGs is assessed as having benefits (+), dis-benefits (-) or not clear or 
mixed (•) based on the impacts of the climate response and adaptation option on each SDG. Areas not coloured indicate there is no evidence of a relation or no interaction with the 
respective SDG. The climate responses and adaptation options are drawn from two assessments. For comparability of climate responses and adaptation options see Table SM17.5.

Summary for Policymakers
C.2.8	
Sea level rise poses a distinctive and severe adaptation challenge as it implies dealing with slow onset changes and increased frequency 
and magnitude of extreme sea level events which will escalate in the coming decades (high confidence). Such adaptation challenges 
would occur much earlier under high rates of sea level rise, in particular if low-likelihood, high impact outcomes associated with 
collapsing ice sheets occur (high confidence). Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence in low-lying coastal cities and 
settlements and small islands include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation (high confidence)45. These responses 
are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and development priorities, 
and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes (high confidence). { 6.2, 10.4, 11.7, Box 11.6, 13.2, 14.5, 15.5, CCP2.3,

C.2.9	
Approximately 3.4 billion people globally live in rural areas around the world, and many are highly vulnerable to climate change. 
Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works programmes, is highly feasible 
and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure. Social safety nets are 
increasingly being reconfigured to build adaptive capacities of the most vulnerable in rural and also urban communities. Social safety 
nets that support climate change adaptation have strong co-benefits with development goals such as education, poverty alleviation, 
gender inclusion and food security. (high confidence) {5.14, 9.4, 9.10, 9.11, 12.5, 14.5, CCP5.4, CCB FEASIB, CCB GENDER}
Energy System Transition
C.2.10	
Within energy system transitions, the most feasible adaptation options support infrastructure resilience, reliable power systems 
and efficient water use for existing and new energy generation systems (very high confidence). Energy generation diversification, 
including with renewable energy resources and generation that can be decentralised depending on context (e.g., wind, solar, small 
scale hydroelectric) and demand side management (e.g., storage, and energy efficiency improvements) can reduce vulnerabilities to 
climate change, especially in rural populations (high confidence). Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation 
are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming (medium confidence). 
Climate responsive energy markets, updated design standards on energy assets according to current and projected climate change, 
smart-grid technologies, robust transmission systems and improved capacity to respond to supply deficits have high feasibility in the 
medium- to long-term, with mitigation co-benefits (very high confidence). {4.6, 4.7, Figure 4.28, Figure 4.29, 10.4, Table 11.8, 13.6, 
Figure 13.16, Figure 13.19, 18.3,CCP5.2, CCP5.4, CCB FEASIB, CWGB BIOECONOMY}
Cross-cutting Options
C.2.11	
Strengthening the climate resiliency of health systems will protect and promote human health and well-being (high confidence). There 
are multiple opportunities for targeted investments and finance to protect against exposure to climate hazards, particularly for those 
at highest risk. Heat Health Action Plans that include early warning and response systems are effective adaptation options for extreme 
heat (high confidence). Effective adaptation options for water-borne and food-borne diseases include improving access to potable 
water, reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding and extreme weather events, and improved early warning systems 
(very high confidence). For vector-borne diseases, effective adaptation options include surveillance, early warning systems, and vaccine 
development (very high confidence). Effective adaptation options for reducing mental health risks under climate change include improving 
surveillance, access to mental health care, and monitoring of psychosocial impacts from extreme weather events (high confidence). Health 
and well-being would benefit from integrated adaptation approaches that mainstream health into food, livelihoods, social protection, 
infrastructure, water and sanitation policies requiring collaboration and coordination at all scales of governance (very high confidence).

C.2.12 	 Increasing adaptive capacities minimises the negative impacts of climate-related displacement and involuntary migration for migrants 
and sending and receiving areas (high confidence). This improves the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made, 
ensuring safe and orderly movements of people within and between countries (high confidence). Some development reduces underlying 
vulnerabilities associated with conflict, and adaptation contributes by reducing the impacts of climate change on climate sensitive 
drivers of conflict (high confidence). Risks to peace are reduced, for example, by supporting people in climate-sensitive economic 
activities (medium confidence) and advancing women’s empowerment (high confidence). {7.4, Box 9.8, Box 10.2, 12.5, CCB FEASIB,

The term ‘response’ is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, may or may not be considered to be adaptation.

Summary for Policymakers
C.2.13	
There are a range of adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading 
and sharing that have broad applicability across sectors and provide greater benefits to other adaptation options when combined (high 
confidence). For example, climate services that are inclusive of different users and providers can improve agricultural practices, inform 
better water use and efficiency, and enable resilient infrastructure planning (high confidence). {2.6, 3.6, 4.7, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.8, 5.9, 5.12,

Limits to Adaptation
46	
Climate literacy encompasses being aware of climate change, its anthropogenic causes and implications.
C.3	
Soft limits to some human adaptation have been reached, but can be overcome by addressing a range of constraints, 
primarily financial, governance, institutional and policy constraints (high confidence). Hard limits to adaptation have been 
reached in some ecosystems (high confidence). With increasing global warming, losses and damages will increase and 
additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation limits (high confidence). {Figure TS.7, 1.4, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.4, 3.6, 
4.7, Figure 4.30, 5.5, Table 8.6, Box 10.7, 11.7, Table 11.16, 12.5, 13.2, 13.5, 13.6, 13.10, 13.11, Figure 13.21, 14.5, 15.6, 16.4,

C.3.1	
Soft limits to some human adaptation have been reached, but can be overcome by addressing a range of constraints, which primarily 
consist of financial, governance, institutional and policy constraints (high confidence). For example, individuals and households in 
low-lying coastal areas in Australasia and Small Islands and smallholder farmers in Central and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia 
have reached soft limits (medium confidence). Inequity and poverty also constrain adaptation, leading to soft limits and resulting in 
disproportionate exposure and impacts for most vulnerable groups (high confidence). Lack of climate literacy46 at all levels and limited 
availability of information and data pose further constraints to adaptation planning and implementation (medium confidence). {1.4, 4.7, 
5.4, 8.4, Table 8.6, 9.1, 9.4, 9.5, 9.8, 11.7, 12.5 13.5, 15.3, 15.5, 15.6, 16.4, Box 16.1, Figure 16.8, CCP5.2, CCP5.4, CCP6.3}
C.3.2	
Financial constraints are important determinants of soft limits to adaptation across sectors and all regions (high confidence). Although 
global tracked climate finance has shown an upward trend since AR5, current global financial flows for adaptation, including from 
public and private finance sources, are insufficient for and constrain implementation of adaptation options especially in developing 
countries (high confidence). The overwhelming majority of global tracked climate finance was targeted to mitigation while a small 
proportion was targeted to adaptation (very high confidence). Adaptation finance has come predominantly from public sources (very 
high confidence). Adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages and 
through impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation, particularly for developing 
and least developed countries (medium confidence). {Figure TS.7, 1.4, 2.6, 3.6, 4.7, Figure 4.30, 5.14, 7.4, 8.4, Table 8.6, 9.4, 9.9, 9.11, 
10.5, 12.5, 13.3, 13.11, Box 14.4, 15.6, 16.2, 16.4, Figure 16.8, Table 16.4, 17.4, 18.1, CCP2.4, CCP5.4, CCP6.3, CCB FINANCE}
C.3.3	
Many natural systems are near the hard limits of their natural adaptation capacity and additional systems will reach limits with 
increasing global warming (high confidence). Ecosystems already reaching or surpassing hard adaptation limits include some warm-­
water coral reefs, some coastal wetlands, some rainforests, and some polar and mountain ecosystems (high confidence). Above 1.5°C 
global warming level, some Ecosystem-based Adaptation measures will lose their effectiveness in providing benefits to people as these 
ecosystems will reach hard adaptation limits (high confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {1.4, 2.4, 2.6, 3.4, 3.6, 9.6, Box 11.2, 13.4, 14.5, 15.5, 
16.4, 16.6, 17.2, CCP1.2, CCP5.2, CCP6.3, CCP7.3, CCB SLR}
C.3.4	
In human systems, some coastal settlements face soft adaptation limits due to technical and financial difficulties of implementing 
coastal protection (high confidence). Above 1.5°C global warming level, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits for 
Small Islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow-melt (medium confidence). By 2°C global warming level, soft limits are 
projected for multiple staple crops in many growing areas, particularly in tropical regions (high confidence). By 3°C global warming 
level, soft limits are projected for some water management measures for many regions, with hard limits projected for parts of Europe 
(medium confidence). Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits (high 
confidence). {1.4, 4.7, 5.4, 5.8, 7.2, 7.3, 8.4, Table 8.6, 9.8, 10.4, 12.5, 13.2, 13.6, 16.4, 17.2, CCP1.3. Box CCP1.1, CCP2.3, CCP3.3, 
CCP4.4, CCP5.3, CCB SLR}
C.3.5	
Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses 
and damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, 
governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. With increasing global warming, losses and 
damages increase and become increasingly difficult to avoid, while strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. 
(high confidence) {1.4, 2.6, 3.4, 3.6, 6.3, Figure 6.4, 8.4, 13.2, 13.7, 13.10, 17.2, CCP2.3, CCP4.4, CCB LOSS, CCB SLR, CWGB ECONOMIC}

Summary for Policymakers
Avoiding Maladaptation
47	
From AR5, an option that would generate net social and/or economic benefits under current climate change and a range of future climate change scenarios, and represent one example of robust 
strategies.
C.4	
There is increased evidence of maladaptation15 across many sectors and regions since the AR5. Maladaptive responses 
to climate change can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult and expensive to change and 
exacerbate existing inequalities. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive and long-term plan-
ning and implementation of adaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and systems. (high confidence) {1.3, 1.4, 
2.6, Box 2.2, 3.2, 3.6, 4.6, 4.7, Box 4.3, Box 4.5, Figure 4.29, 5.6, 5.13, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.6, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, Box 9.5, 
Box 9.8, Box 9.9, Box 11.6, 13.11, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 14.5, 15.5, 15.6, 16.3, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 17.6, CCP2.3, CCP2.3, 
CCP5.4, CCB DEEP, CCB NATURAL, CCB SLR, CWGB BIOECONOMY}
C.4.1	
Actions that focus on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation if long-term impacts of 
the adaptation option and long-term adaptation commitment are not taken into account (high confidence). The implementation of 
these maladaptive actions can result in infrastructure and institutions that are inflexible and/or expensive to change (high confidence). 
For example, seawalls effectively reduce impacts to people and assets in the short-term but can also result in lock-ins and increase 
exposure to climate risks in the long-term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan (high confidence). Adaptation 
integrated with development reduces lock-ins and creates opportunities (e.g., infrastructure upgrading) (medium confidence). {1.4, 3.4, 
3.6, 10.4, 11.7, Box 11.6, 13.2, 17.2, 17.5, 17.6, CCP 2.3, CCB DEEP, CCB SLR}
C.4.2	
Biodiversity and ecosystem resilience to climate change are decreased by maladaptive actions, which also constrain ecosystem 
services. Examples of these maladaptive actions for ecosystems include fire suppression in naturally fire-adapted ecosystems or hard 
defences against flooding. These actions reduce space for natural processes and represent a severe form of maladaptation for the 
ecosystems they degrade, replace or fragment, thereby reducing their resilience to climate change and the ability to provide ecosystem 
services for adaptation. Considering biodiversity and autonomous adaptation in long-term planning processes reduces the risk of 
maladaptation. (high confidence) {2.4, 2.6, Table 2.7, 3.4, 3.6, 4.7, 5.6, 5.13, Table 5.21, Table 5.23, Box 11.2, 13.2, Box 13.2, 17.2, 17.5, 
CCP5.4}
C.4.3	
Maladaptation especially affects marginalised and vulnerable groups adversely (e.g., Indigenous Peoples, ethnic minorities, low-income 
households, informal settlements), reinforcing and entrenching existing inequities. Adaptation planning and implementation that do not 
consider adverse outcomes for different groups can lead to maladaptation, increasing exposure to risks, marginalising people from certain 
socioeconomic or livelihood groups, and exacerbating inequity. Inclusive planning initiatives informed by cultural values, Indigenous 
knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge can help prevent maladaptation. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.4) {2.6, 3.6, 4.3, 
4.6, 4.8, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14, 6.1, Box 7.1, 8.4, 11.4, 12.5, Box 13.2, 14.4, Box 14.1, 17.2, 17.5, 18.2, 17.2, CCP2.4}
C.4.4	
To minimize maladaptation, multi-sectoral, multi-actor and inclusive planning with flexible pathways encourages low-regret47 and 
timely actions that keep options open, ensure benefits in multiple sectors and systems and indicate the available solution space for 
adapting to long-term climate change (very high confidence). Maladaptation is also minimized by planning that accounts for the time it 
takes to adapt (high confidence), the uncertainty about the rate and magnitude of climate risk (medium confidence) and a wide range 
of potentially adverse consequences of adaptation actions (high confidence). {1.4, 3.6, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14, 11.6, 11.7, 17.3, 17.6, CCP2.3, 
CCP2.4, CCP5.4, CCB DEEP, CCB SLR}
Enabling Conditions
C.5	
Enabling conditions are key for implementing, accelerating and sustaining adaptation in human systems and ecosystems. 
These include political commitment and follow-through, institutional frameworks, policies and instruments with clear 
goals and priorities, enhanced knowledge on impacts and solutions, mobilization of and access to adequate financial re-
sources, monitoring and evaluation, and inclusive governance processes. (high confidence) {1.4, 2.6, 3.6, 4.8, 6.4, 7.4, 8.5, 
9.4, 10.5, 11.4, 11.7, 12.5, 13.11, 14.7, 15.6, 17.4, 18.4, CCP2.4, CCP5.4, CCB FINANCE, CCB INDIG}
C.5.1	
Political commitment and follow-through across all levels of government accelerate the implementation of adaptation actions 
(high confidence). Implementing actions can require large upfront investments of human, financial and technological resources 
(high confidence), whilst some benefits could only become visible in the next decade or beyond (medium confidence). Accelerating 
commitment and follow-through is promoted by rising public awareness, building business cases for adaptation, accountability and 
transparency mechanisms, monitoring and evaluation of adaptation progress, social movements, and climate-related litigation in some 
regions (medium confidence). {3.6, 4.8, 5.8, 6.4, 8.5, 9.4, 11.7, 12.5, 13.11, 17.4, 17.5, 18.4, CCP2.4, CCB COVID}

SPM
Summary for Policymakers
C.5.2	
Institutional frameworks, policies and instruments that set clear adaptation goals and define responsibilities and commitments and that 
are coordinated amongst actors and governance levels, strengthen and sustain adaptation actions (very high confidence). Sustained 
adaptation actions are strengthened by mainstreaming adaptation into institutional budget and policy planning cycles, statutory 
planning, monitoring and evaluation frameworks and into recovery efforts from disaster events (high confidence). Instruments that 
incorporate adaptation such as policy and legal frameworks, behavioural incentives, and economic instruments that address market 
failures, such as climate risk disclosure, inclusive and deliberative processes strengthen adaptation actions by public and private actors 
(medium confidence). {1.4, 3.6, 4.8, 5.14, 6.3, 6.4, 7.4, 9.4, 10.4, 11.7, Box 11.6, Table 11.17, 13.10, 13.11, 14.7, 15.6, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 
17.6, 18.4, CCP2.4, CCP5.4, CCP6.3, CCB DEEP}
C.5.3	
Enhancing knowledge on risks, impacts, and their consequences, and available adaptation options promotes societal and policy 
responses (high confidence). A wide range of top-down, bottom-up and co-produced processes and sources can deepen climate 
knowledge and sharing, including capacity building at all scales, educational and information programmes, using the arts, participatory 
modelling and climate services, Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and citizen science (high confidence). These measures can 
facilitate awareness, heighten risk perception and influence behaviours (high confidence). {1.3, 3.6, 4.8, 5.9, 5.14, 6.4, Table 6.8, 7.4, 
9.4, 10.5, 11.1, 11.7, 12.5, 13.9, 13.11, 14.3, 15.6, 15.6, 17.4, 18.4, CCP2.4.1, CCB INDIG}
C.5.4	
With adaptation finance needs estimated to be higher than those presented in AR5, enhanced mobilization of and access to financial 
resources are essential for implementation of adaptation and to reduce adaptation gaps (high confidence). Building capacity and 
removing some barriers to accessing finance is fundamental to accelerate adaptation, especially for vulnerable groups, regions and 
sectors (high confidence). Public and private finance instruments include inter alia grants, guarantee, equity, concessional debt, 
market debt, and internal budget allocation as well as savings in households and insurance. Public finance is an important enabler 
of adaptation (high confidence). Public mechanisms and finance can leverage private sector finance for adaptation by addressing 
real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers, for example via public-private partnerships (high confidence). Financial and 
technological resources enable effective and ongoing implementation of adaptation, especially when supported by institutions with a 
strong understanding of adaptation needs and capacity (high confidence). {4.8, 5.14, 6.4, Table 6.10, 7.4, 9.4, Table 11.17, 12.5, 13.11, 
15.6, 17.4, 18.4, Box 18.9, CCP5.4, CCB FINANCE}
C.5.5	
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of adaptation are critical for tracking progress and enabling effective adaptation (high confidence). 
M&E implementation is currently limited (high confidence) but has increased since AR5 at local and national levels. Although most of 
the monitoring of adaptation is focused towards planning and implementation, the monitoring of outcomes is critical for tracking the 
effectiveness and progress of adaptation (high confidence). M&E facilitates learning on successful and effective adaptation measures, 
and signals when and where additional action may be needed. M&E systems are most effective when supported by capacities and 
resources and embedded in enabling governance systems (high confidence). {1.4, 2.6, 6.4, 7.4, 11.7, 11.8, 13.2, 13.11, 17.5, 18.4, 
CCP2.4, CCB DEEP, CCB ILLNESS, CCB NATURAL, CCB PROGRESS}
C.5.6	
Inclusive governance that prioritises equity and justice in adaptation planning and implementation leads to more effective and 
sustainable adaptation outcomes (high confidence). Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often reduced through carefully designed and 
implemented laws, policies, processes, and interventions that address context specific inequities such as based on gender, ethnicity, 
disability, age, location and income (high confidence). These approaches, which include multi-stakeholder co-learning platforms, 
transboundary collaborations, community-based adaptation and participatory scenario planning, focus on capacity-building, and 
meaningful participation of the most vulnerable and marginalised groups, and their access to key resources to adapt (high confidence).

D: Climate Resilient Development
Climate resilient development integrates adaptation measures and their enabling conditions (Section C) with mitigation to advance sustainable 
development for all. Climate resilient development involves questions of equity and system transitions in land, ocean and ecosystems; urban 
and infrastructure; energy; industry; and society and includes adaptations for human, ecosystem and planetary health. Pursuing climate resilient 
development focuses on both where people and ecosystems are co-located as well as the protection and maintenance of ecosystem function at 
the planetary scale. Pathways for advancing climate resilient development are development trajectories that successfully integrate mitigation and 
adaptation actions to advance sustainable development. Climate resilient development pathways may be temporarily coincident with any RCP 
and SSP scenario used throughout AR6, but do not follow any particular scenario in all places and over all time.

Summary for Policymakers
Conditions for Climate Resilient Development
D.1	
Evidence of observed impacts, projected risks, levels and trends in vulnerability, and adaptation limits, demonstrate that 
worldwide climate resilient development action is more urgent than previously assessed in AR5. Comprehensive, effective, 
and innovative responses can harness synergies and reduce trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation to advance 
sustainable development. (very high confidence) {2.6, 3.4, 3.6, 4.2, 4.6, 7.2, 7.4, 8.3, 8.4, 9.3, 10.6, 13.3, 13.8, 13.10, 14.7, 
17.2, 18.3, Box 18.1, Figure 18.1, Table 18.5}
D.1.1	
There is a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to enable climate resilient development. Multiple climate resilient development 
pathways are still possible by which communities, the private sector, governments, nations and the world can pursue climate resilient 
development – each involving and resulting from different societal choices influenced by different contexts and opportunities and 
constraints on system transitions.   Climate resilient development pathways are progressively constrained by every increment of 
warming, in particular beyond 1.5°C, social and economic inequalities, the balance between adaptation and mitigation varying by 
national, regional and local circumstances and geographies, according to capabilities including resources, vulnerability, culture and 
values, past development choices leading to past emissions and future warming scenarios, bounding the climate resilient development 
pathways remaining, and the ways in which development trajectories are shaped by equity, and social and climate justice. (very high 
confidence) {Figure TS.14d, 2.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.14, 6.4, 7.4, 8.3, 9.4, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 10.6, 11.8, 12.5, 13.10, 14.7, 15.3, 18.5, CCP2.3, CCP3.4, 
CCP4.4, CCP5.3, CCP5.4, Table CCP5.2, CCP6.3, CCP7.5}
D.1.2	
Opportunities for climate resilient development are not equitably distributed around the world (very high confidence). Climate impacts 
and risks exacerbate vulnerability and social and economic inequities and consequently increase persistent and acute development 
challenges, especially in developing regions and sub-regions, and in particularly exposed sites, including coasts, small islands, deserts, 
mountains and polar regions. This in turn undermines efforts to achieve sustainable development, particularly for vulnerable and 
marginalized communities (very high confidence). {2.5, 4.4, 4.7, 6.3, Box 6.4, Figure 6.5, 9.4, Table 18.5, CCP2.2, CCP3.2, CCP3.3, 
CCP5.4, CCP6.2, CCB HEALTH, CWGB URBAN}
D.1.3	
Embedding effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation in development planning can reduce vulnerability, conserve and restore 
ecosystems, and enable climate resilient development. This is especially challenging in localities with persistent development gaps 
and limited resources (high confidence).  Dynamic trade-offs and competing priorities exist between mitigation, adaptation, and 
development. Integrated and inclusive system-oriented solutions based on equity and social and climate justice reduce risks and enable 
climate resilient development (high confidence). {1.4, 2.6, Box 2.2, 3.6, 4.7, 4.8, Box 4.5, Box 4.8, 5.13, 7.4, 8.5, 9.4, Box 9.3, 10.6, 12.5,

Enabling Climate Resilient Development
D.2	
Climate resilient development is enabled when governments, civil society and the private sector make inclusive de-
velopment choices that prioritise risk reduction, equity and justice, and when decision-making processes, finance and 
actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors and timeframes (very high confidence). Climate resilient devel-
opment is facilitated by international cooperation and by governments at all levels working with communities, civil 
society, educational bodies, scientific and other institutions, media, investors and businesses; and by developing partner-
ships with traditionally marginalised groups, including women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities and ethnic 
minorities (high confidence). These partnerships are most effective when supported by enabling political leadership, 
institutions, resources, including finance, as well as climate services, information and decision support tools (high confi-
dence). (Figure SPM.5) {1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.7, 3.6, 4.8, 5.14, 6.4, 7.4, 8.5, 8.6, 9.4, 10.6, 11.8, 12.5, 13.11, 14.7, 15.6, 15.7, 17.4,

NATURAL, CCB SLR}
D.2.1	
Climate resilient development is advanced when actors work in equitable, just and enabling ways to reconcile divergent interests, values 
and worldviews, toward equitable and just outcomes (high confidence). These practices build on diverse knowledges about climate 
risk and chosen development pathways account for local, regional and global climate impacts, risks, barriers and opportunities (high 
confidence). Structural vulnerabilities to climate change can be reduced through carefully designed and implemented legal, policy, and 
process interventions from the local to global that address inequities based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income 
(very high confidence). This includes rights-based approaches that focus on capacity-building, meaningful participation of the most 
vulnerable groups, and their access to key resources, including financing, to reduce risk and adapt (high confidence). Evidence shows that 
climate resilient development processes link scientific, Indigenous, local, practitioner and other forms of knowledge, and are more effective 
and sustainable because they are locally appropriate and lead to more legitimate, relevant and effective actions (high confidence).

Summary for Policymakers
Pathways towards climate resilient development overcome jurisdictional and organizational barriers, and are founded on societal 
choices that accelerate and deepen key system transitions (very high confidence). Planning processes and decision analysis tools 
can help identify ‘low regrets’ options47 that enable mitigation and adaptation in the face of change, complexity, deep uncertainty 
and divergent views (medium confidence). {1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.7, 3.6, 4.8, 5.14, 6.4, 7.4, 8.5, 8.6, Box 8.7, 9.4, Box 9.2, 10.6, 11.8, 12.5,

Inclusive governance contributes to more effective and enduring adaptation outcomes and enables climate resilient development (high 
confidence). Inclusive processes strengthen the ability of governments and other stakeholders to jointly consider factors such as the rate 
and magnitude of change and uncertainties, associated impacts, and timescales of different climate resilient development pathways 
given past development choices leading to past emissions and scenarios of future global warming (high confidence). Associated 
societal choices are made continuously through interactions in arenas of engagement from local to international levels. The quality 
and outcome of these interactions helps determine whether development pathways shift towards or away from climate resilient 
development (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.5) {2.7, 3.6, 4.8, 5.14, 6.4, 7.4, 8.5, 8.6, 9.4, 10.6, 11.8, 12.5, 13.11, 14.7, 15.6, 15.7,

D.2.3	
Governance for climate resilient development is most effective when supported by formal and informal institutions and practices that 
are well-aligned across scales, sectors, policy domains and timeframes. Governance efforts that advance climate resilient development 
account for the dynamic, uncertain and context-specific nature of climate-related risk, and its interconnections with non-climate 
risks. Institutions48 that enable climate resilient development are flexible and responsive to emergent risks and facilitate sustained 
and timely action. Governance for climate resilient development is enabled by adequate and appropriate human and technological 
resources, information, capacities and finance. (high confidence) {2.7, 3.6, 4.8, 5.14, 6.3, 6.4, 7.4, 8.5, 8.6, 9.4, 10.6, 11.8, 12.5, 13.11,

Institutions: Rules, norms and conventions that guide, constrain or enable human behaviours and practices. Institutions can be formally established, for instance through laws and regulations, or 
informally established, for instance by traditions or customs. Institutions may spur, hinder, strengthen, weaken or distort the emergence, adoption and implementation of climate action and climate 
governance.
D.3	
Interactions between changing urban form, exposure and vulnerability can create climate change-induced risks and losses 
for cities and settlements. However, the global trend of urbanisation also offers a critical opportunity in the near-term, 
to advance climate resilient development (high confidence). Integrated, inclusive planning and investment in everyday 
decision-making about urban infrastructure, including social, ecological and grey/physical infrastructures, can significantly 
increase the adaptive capacity of urban and rural settlements. Equitable outcomes contributes to multiple benefits for 
health and well-being and ecosystem services, including for Indigenous Peoples, marginalised and vulnerable communi-
ties (high confidence). Climate resilient development in urban areas also supports adaptive capacity in more rural places 
through maintaining peri-urban supply chains of goods and services and financial flows (medium confidence). Coastal 
cities and settlements play an especially important role in advancing climate resilient development (high confidence).

Figure SPM.5 |  Climate resilient development (CRD) is the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support sustainable 
development. This figure builds on Figure SPM.9 in AR5 WGII (depicting climate resilient pathways) by describing how CRD pathways are the result of cumulative societal choices 
and actions within multiple arenas. 
Panel (a)  Societal choices towards higher CRD (green cog) or lower CRD (red cog) result from interacting decisions and actions by diverse government, private sector 
and civil society actors, in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. These actors engage with adaptation, mitigation and development actions in 
political, economic and financial, ecological, socio-cultural, knowledge and technology, and community arenas from local to international levels. Opportunities for climate resilient 
development are not equitably distributed around the world. 
Panel (b)  Cumulatively, societal choices, which are made continuously, shift global development pathways towards higher (green) or lower (red) climate resilient development. 
Past conditions (past emissions, climate change and development) have already eliminated some development pathways towards higher CRD (dashed green line). 
Panel (c)  Higher CRD is characterised by outcomes that advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development is progressively harder to achieve with global 
warming levels beyond 1.5°C. Inadequate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 reduces climate resilient development prospects. There is a 
narrowing window of opportunity to shift pathways towards more climate resilient development futures as reflected by the adaptation limits and increasing climate risks, considering 
the remaining carbon budgets. (Figure SPM.2, Figure SPM.3) {Figure TS.14b, 2.6, 3.6, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 16.4, 16.5, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, Box 18.1,

Summary for Policymakers
D.3.1	
Taking integrated action for climate resilience to avoid climate risk requires urgent decision making for the new built environment 
and retrofitting existing urban design, infrastructure and land use. Based on socioeconomic circumstances, adaptation and 
sustainable development actions will provide multiple benefits including for health and well-being, particularly when supported by 
national governments, non-governmental organisations and international agencies  that work across sectors in partnerships with 
local communities. Equitable partnerships between local and municipal governments, the private sector, Indigenous Peoples, local 
communities, and civil society can, including through international cooperation, advance climate resilient development by addressing 
structural inequalities, insufficient financial resources, cross-city risks and the integration of Indigenous knowledge and local 
knowledge. (high confidence) {6.2, 6.3, 6.4, Table 6.6, 7.4, 8.5, 9.4, 10.5. 12.5, 17.4, Table 17.8, 18.2, Box 18.1, CCP2.4, CCB FINANCE, 
CCB GENDER, CCB INDIG, CWGB URBAN}
D.3.2	
Rapid global urbanisation offers opportunities for climate resilient development in diverse contexts from rural and informal settlements 
to large metropolitan areas (high confidence). Dominant models of energy intensive and market-led urbanisation, insufficient and 
misaligned finance and a predominant focus on grey infrastructure in the absence of integration with ecological and social approaches, 
risks missing opportunities for adaptation and locking in maladaptation (high confidence). Poor land use planning and siloed approaches 
to health, ecological and social planning also exacerbates, vulnerability in already marginalised communities (medium confidence). 
Urban climate resilient development is observed to be more effective if it is responsive to regional and local land use development 
and adaptation gaps, and addresses the underlying drivers of vulnerability (high confidence). The greatest gains in well-being can be 
achieved by prioritizing finance to reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalized residents including people living in informal 
settlements (high confidence). {5.14, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, Figure 6.5, Table 6.6, 7.4, 8.5, 8.6, 9.8, 9.9, 10.4, Table 17.8, 18.2, CCP2.2, 
CCP5.4, CCB HEALTH, CWGB URBAN}
D.3.3	
Urban systems are critical, interconnected sites for enabling climate resilient development, especially at the coast. Coastal cities and 
settlements play a key role in moving toward higher climate resilient development given firstly, almost 11% of the global population – 
896 million people – lived within the Low Elevation Coastal Zone49 in 2020, potentially increasing to beyond 1 billion people by 2050, 
and these people, and associated development and coastal ecosystems, face escalating climate compounded risks, including sea level 
rise. Secondly, these coastal cities and settlements make key contributions to climate resilient development through their vital role in 
national economies and inland communities, global trade supply chains, cultural exchange, and centres of innovation. (high confidence)

Ecosystem integrity refers to the ability of ecosystems to maintain key ecological processes, recover from disturbance, and adapt to new conditions.
D.4	
Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilient development, in light of the threats climate 
change poses to them and their roles in adaptation and mitigation (very high confidence). Recent analyses, drawing on a 
range of lines of evidence, suggest that maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale 
depends on effective and equitable conservation of approximately 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean 
areas, including currently near-natural ecosystems (high confidence). {2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, Box 3.4, 12.5, 13.3, 13.4,

D.4.1 	
Building the resilience of biodiversity and supporting ecosystem integrity50 can maintain benefits for people, including livelihoods, 
human health and well-being and the provision of food, fibre and water, as well as contributing to disaster risk reduction and climate 
change adaptation and mitigation. {2.2, 2.5, 2.6, Table 2.6, Table 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 5.8, 5.13, 5.14, Box 5.11, 12.5, CCP5.4, CCB COVID, CCB

D.4.2 	
Protecting and restoring ecosystems  is  essential for  maintaining and enhancing the resilience of the biosphere (very high 
confidence). Degradation and loss of ecosystems is also a cause of greenhouse gas emissions and is at increasing risk of being 
exacerbated by climate change impacts, including droughts and wildfire  (high confidence).  Climate resilient development 
avoids adaptation and mitigation measures that damage ecosystems (high confidence).  Documented examples of adverse impacts of 
land-based measures intended as mitigation, when poorly implemented, include afforestation of grasslands, savannas and peatlands, 
and risks from bioenergy crops at large scale to water supply, food security and biodiversity (high confidence). {2.4, 2.5, Box 2.2, 3.4,

Summary for Policymakers
D.4.3	
Biodiversity and ecosystem services have limited capacity to adapt to increasing global warming levels, which will make climate resil-
ient development progressively harder to achieve beyond 1.5°C warming (very high confidence). Consequences of current and future 
global warming for climate resilient development include reduced effectiveness of Ecosystem-based Adaptation and approaches to 
climate change mitigation based on ecosystems and amplifying feedbacks to the climate system (high confidence). {Figure TS.14d, 2.4,

Achieving Climate Resilient Development
D.5	
It is unequivocal that climate change has already disrupted human and natural systems. Past and current development 
trends (past emissions, development and climate change) have not advanced global climate resilient development (very 
high confidence). Societal choices and actions implemented in the next decade determine the extent to which medium- 
and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development (high confidence). Importantly climate 
resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, es-
pecially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near-term (high confidence). These prospects are constrained by past 
development, emissions and climate change, and enabled by inclusive governance, adequate and appropriate human and 
technological resources, information, capacities and finance (high confidence). {Figure TS.14d, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.6,

D.5.1	
Climate resilient development is already challenging at current global warming levels (high confidence). The prospects for climate 
resilient development will be further limited if global warming levels exceeds 1.5°C (high confidence) and not be possible in some 
regions and sub-regions if the global warming level exceeds 2°C (medium confidence).  Climate resilient development is most 
constrained in regions/subregions in which climate impacts and risks are already advanced, including low-lying coastal cities and 
settlements, small islands, deserts, mountains and polar regions (high confidence). Regions and subregions with high levels of poverty, 
water, food and energy insecurity, vulnerable urban environments, degraded ecosystems and rural environments, and/or few enabling 
conditions, face many non-climate challenges that inhibit climate resilient development which are further exacerbated by climate 
change (high confidence). {Figure TS.14d, 1.2, Box 6.6, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 10.6, 11.8, 12.5, 13.10, 14.7, 15.3, CCP2.3, CCP3.4, CCP4.4, CCP5.3, 
Table CCP5.2, CCP6.3, CCP7.5}
D.5.2	
Inclusive governance, investment aligned with climate resilient development, access to appropriate technology and rapidly 
scaled-up finance, and capacity building of governments at all levels, the private sector and civil society enable climate resilient 
development. Experience shows that climate resilient development processes are timely, anticipatory, integrative, flexible and action 
focused. Common goals and social learning build adaptive capacity for climate resilient development. When implementing adaptation 
and mitigation together, and taking trade-offs into account, multiple benefits and synergies for human well-being as well as ecosystem 
and planetary health can be realised. Prospects for climate resilient development are increased by inclusive processes involving local 
knowledge and Indigenous Knowledge as well as processes that coordinate across risks and institutions. Climate resilient development 
is enabled by increased international cooperation including mobilising and enhancing access to finance, particularly for vulnerable 
regions, sectors and groups. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.5) {2.7, 3.6, 4.8, 5.14, 6.4, 7.4, 8.5, 8.6, 9.4, 10.6, 11.8, 12.5, 13.11, 14.7,

D.5.3	
The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health. Any further 
delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity 
to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. (very high confidence) {1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 16.2, Table SM16.24, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 17.4, 17.5,
